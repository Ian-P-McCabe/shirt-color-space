        <h1>Dodgeball League Shirt Color Problem Part 2:</h1>
        <h1>Finding the Perfect Colors</h1>
        <h3>by Ian McCabe</h3>

        <p>
            In part one, we determined which team colors would be best to add to the upcoming dodgeball season. We
            wanted to select colors that would be different from those already chosen, as teams with similar colors
            are hard to tell apart. We used Lab-Color-Distance formulas to select colors that are most distant and
            chose from those.
        </p>

        <p>
            The similar-color-problem in Part 1 arose because teams are allowed to select from 103 shirt colors. Many
            of these colors are very similar, so it is easy for teams to select colors that are hard to tell apart.
            What if we wanted to avoid this situation entirely?
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of letting teams pick from 103 colors, we gave them 16 or 24 colors to select from, and we
            guaranteed that all the colors are far enough apart to not appear too similar.
        </p>

        <h2>Lots of Combinations!</h2>

        <p>
            One way to approach this problem is to select the 16 colors that have the greatest average
            distance between them. This would work, however...
        </p>
        <p>
            If we want to pick 16 colors, we must score 2,245,547,413,628,550,570 possible combinations! (2 quintillion)
        </p>
        <p>
            And if we want to pick 24 colors, we must score 178,409,928,551,259,450,861,900 possible combinations! (178
            sextillion)
        </p>

        <p>
            To put those numbers into context, it would take ~10 days of compute time to find the 16 best colors,
            and ~ 2175 years, 328 days, and 17 hours to find the 24 best colors!
        </p>

        <h2>The Maximum Diversity Problem</h2>

        <p>
            What we're attempting to do, finding a subset of colors with an optimal distance between them, is a
            variation of the <a href="https://grafo.etsii.urjc.es/optsicom/mdp.html" target="_blank">Maximum Diversity
            Problem</a>.
            The Maximum Diversity Problem falls into a class of
            computer science problems that are NP-Hard, or functionally unsolvable. We see the NP-Hard characteristics
            of
            our color selection problem when the compute time goes from 10 days to 2175 years by adding 8 additional
            colors to the number of colors we are selecting.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can work around the complexity of our problem with a heuristic. A heuristic is a
            problem-solving technique that uses shortcuts to find an approximate solution quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>Heuristic 1: Randomly Select Colors</h2>
        <p>
            A simple heuristic we can use is randomly selecting colors from the set of 103. This likely won't yield the
            best results, but scoring these random selections provides a useful baseline for future algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
            I selected 100,000 random combinations of colors and calcualted the average, lowest, and highest score:
        </p>
        <div class="tableDiv">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Metric</th>
                    <th>Score</th>
                    <th>Unit</th>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: lightgreen">
                    <td>Total Runtime</td>
                    <td>3.57</td>
                    <td>Seconds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: pink">
                    <td>Average Score</td>
                    <td>53.4505</td>
                    <td>Perceived LAB Color Distance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: pink">
                    <td>Lowest Score</td>
                    <td>31.01996</td>
                    <td>Perceived LAB Color Distance</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="background-color: lightyellow">
                    <td>Highest Score</td>
                    <td>75.5356</td>
                    <td>Perceived LAB Color Distance</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p> A low scoring (32.52) random color palette looks like this:</p>
        <div id="lowestRandomColors" class="rectangle-container wide-rectangle"></div>
        <p>How drab.</p>

        <p> A high scoring (76.29) random color palette looks like this:</p>
        <div id="highestRandomColors" class="rectangle-container"></div>
        <p>An improvement, but we can do better.</p>

        <h2>Heuristic 2: Greedy Algorithms</h2>

        <div class="GreedyDiv">
            <p>
                Greedy algorithms work by picking the best option at each step of the algorithm. In our case, the
                greedy algorithm will take two points and then iteratively select the 14 points that have the
                greatest minimum distance from the current set.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can easily run this algorithm on every combination of points, as
                <math>

            <p> The lowest scoring (76.29) greedy color palette looks like this:</p>
            <div id="lowestGreedyColors" class="rectangle-container"></div>
            <p>Lots of Blue/Purple and Red/Orange. This is how the dodgeball league looks most seasons.</p>


            <p> The best (81.92) greedy color palette looks like this:</p>
            <div id="highestGreedyColors" class="rectangle-container"></div>
            <p>
                Better! However, Heather Dusty Blue and Heather Prism Dusty Blue are awfully close!
                (They are unique colors though)

            <h2>Heuristic 3: A Convex Hull</h2>
            <p>
                What is a Convex Hull? The formal definition is "The intersection
                of all convex sets containing a given subset of Euclidean space."
            </p>

            <p> What? </p>
            <p>
                An image outlining what the convex hull of a set of points
                looks like is far more intuitive:
            </p>

            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231218123325/Convex-Hull.jpg"
                 alt="Image showing a set of points and the associated convex hull"
                 style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>

            <p>
                The example above is for 2D space, but the idea is the same for 3d space. We can see the convex hull
                for the set of all colors below. (You can move the plots around with your mouse/finger)
            </p>

            <div class="iframeDiv">
                <iframe id='preConvexPlot' height="350" width="350"></iframe>
            </div>

            <div style="width: 100%">
                <img src="assets/down_arrow.svg" alt="Big down arrow."
                     style='width: 15%; object-fit: contain; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px'/>
            </div>

            <div class="iframeDiv">
                <iframe id='convexPlot'></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Incredibly, the convex hull of the shirt colors contains 21 points. We can easily remove the
                5 points with the average closest distance to the set to get us down to 16 colors.
            </p>
