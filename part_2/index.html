        <h1>Dodgeball League Color Problem Part 2:</h1>
        <h1>Finding the Perfect Colors</h1>
        <h3>by Ian McCabe</h3>

        <p>
            The aim of part 1 was to figure out which shirt colors
            are the best to add to those already selected for the season.
            We wanted to figure out which colors are the farthest from those
            already chosen by the league. We used Lab-Color-Distance formulas
            to select colors that are most distant, and chose from those.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ended up doing part 1 because teams are allowed to select from 103 unique shirt colors, so it is easy
            for teams to select colors that are too similar. When teams
            choose colors that are too similar, one team must then select a new color that is deemed
            from all the other colors, so it's easy to tell teams apart. But what if we wanted to avoid this
            situation entirely?
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of letting teams pick from 103 colors, we gave them 16 or 24 colors to pick from that would
            guarantee
            that all the colors are distinct to the human eye.

        <h2>Lots of Combinations!</h2>

        <p>
            One way to approach this problem is to select the 16 colors that have the greatest average
            distance between them. This would work, however:
        </p>
        <p>
            If we want to pick 16 colors, we must run 2,245,547,413,628,550,570 calculations! (2 quintillion)
        </p>
        <p>
            And if we want to pick 24 colors, we must run 178,409,928,551,259,450,861,900 calculations! (178 sextillion)
        </p>

        <p>
            To put those numbers into context, it would take ~10 days of compute time to find the 16 best colors,
            and ~ 2175 years, 328 days, and 17 hours to find the 24 best colors!

        <h2>The Maximum Diversity Problem</h2>

        <p>
            What we're attempting to do, finding a subset of colors with an optimal distance between them, is also
            known as the Maximum Diversity Problem or MDP. The Maximum Diversity Problem falls into a class of
            computer problems that are NP-Hard, or functionally unsolvable. We see the NP-Hard characteristics of
            our color selection problem when the compute time goes from 10 days to 2175 years by adding 8 additional
            colors to the number of colors we are selecting.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can work around the complexity of our problem with a heuristic. A heuristic is a
            problem-solving technique that uses shortcuts to find an approximate solution quickly.
